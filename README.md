# natureSimulator
This is a simulation of a really simple natural habitat.
There are two types of creatures: Herbivores and Plants or Sheep and Grass.
Later we added Carnivores and Omnivores but I couldn't find that version.
The plants are represented as green blocks and omnivores are represented as red blocks.
The color of a creature gets darker as its health gets bigger.
The plants photosynthesize and get health constantly and the omnivores lose health constantly unless they eat a plant.
Moving takes up more health from the omnivores so they stop moving if their health gets really low to live longer.
After reaching some health all creatures reproduce.
When every little creature follows these rules, what we get is a simplistic ature simulator.
